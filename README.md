 :yellow_heart: My open-source adventure began with an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) internship and working on [Wikimedia’s](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) project [Programs & Events Dashboard](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard).
 
 :computer: My stack includes JavaScript, Ruby, RoR, React, MySQL...
