 # Hello Visitor 🤘
    
 🌱 As a developer at [Fix The Status Quo](https://proca.app/), I'm building software for progressive and nonprofit online campaigns.
 
 🛠️ Check out our awesome projects [here](https://github.com/fixthestatusquo/).
 
 :yellow_heart: My open-source adventure began with an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) internship and working on [Wikimedia’s](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) project [Programs & Events Dashboard](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard).
 
 :computer: My stack includes JavaScript, Typescript, Ruby, RoR, React, MySQL...
 
 :heavy_plus_sign: Currently, I'm trying to figure out Elixir.
